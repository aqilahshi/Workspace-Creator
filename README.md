#### Workspace Creator(Description):
This subsystem is designed for committees only. The purpose of this subsystem is to make sure the communication among teammates is more effective as they no need to set up so many groups in different platforms. In this web application, they can just easily communicate with their own teammate about project status and needs. Next, the teammate also creates to-do lists and assign action items to teammate and tag them, so they get an instant notification, making it easy to track the overall progress in any project.
